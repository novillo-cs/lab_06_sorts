## Directions

* In Sorts.java. You must implement the 3 sorting algortihms that we learned in classs. Please do not change the method signatures:

```
  public static void bubbleSort(int[] data) { }

  public static void selectionSort(int[] data)  { }

  public static void insertionSort(int[] data)  { }
```
  

* In Driver.java, you must generate random arrays that will be passed as arguments to your sorting methods. Write the method:

`public static int[] getRandomArray(int size) { }`

This method should create and return an integer array of the specified size, filled with random values.
Use Math.random() or the Random class to generate the numbers.

* If you want to reuse the same random array for all sorting algoritms you must generate copies of your array (Arrays.copyOf() or Objects.clone()).
  
* Do not use ArrayList.
  
* The methods in Sorts.java should be static and void.

* Your methods must not produce any output when they finish. Although using print statements during debugging is fine, they should be completely removed in your final submission.

* Once you create an array to test your method, make a copy of it. This allows you to compare the results of your sort with Java’s built-in sort (Arrays.sort(yourArray)), using the original array for your method and the copied array for the built-in method.
